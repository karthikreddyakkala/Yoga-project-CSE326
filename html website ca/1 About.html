    <h2>This website is is about fitness. Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of sports, 
    occupations and daily activities. Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper nutrition, moderate-vigorous physical exercise, 
    and sufficient rest along with a formal recovery plan.Fitness is defined as the quality or state of being fit and healthy.<br><br>Around 1950, 
    perhaps consistent with the Industrial Revolution and the treatise of World War II, the term "fitness" increased in western vernacular by a factor of ten.
    The modern definition of fitness describes either a person or machine's ability to perform a specific function or a holistic definition of human adaptability to cope with 
    various situations.<br><br> This has led to an interrelation of human fitness and physical attractiveness that has mobilized global fitness and fitness equipment industries. Regarding specific function, 
    fitness is attributed to persons who possess significant aerobic or anaerobic ability (i.e., endurance or strength). A well-rounded fitness program improves a person in all aspects of fitness
     compared to practicing only one, such as only cardio/respiratory or only weight training.</h2></div>
