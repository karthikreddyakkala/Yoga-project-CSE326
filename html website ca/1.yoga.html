        <p><b><h1 style="color:brown;">1.Ashtanga Yoga:</h1><i>Ashtanga Yoga is one of the oldest kinds of yoga. This branch of yoga has been mentioned in the Patanjali, a Sanskrit verse book.
             This type of yoga has 8 branches, which is why it is called Ashtanga yoga.
             It includes processes such as yoga positions, postures, breathing, concentration on objects, withdrawal of senses, meditation etc.<br>
            The main benefit of this kind of yoga is the fact that it is supposed to purify the body and the mind at the same time and it is recommended for 
            those people who are looking for a branch of yoga that would let them become physically and mentally fit as well.<br>
            The postures and stances practiced under this type of yoga have to be done in different sets. There are six such sets. These sets are supposed to increase the heat of the body, 
            hence remove impurities from the body, which will eventually lead to mental and spiritual wellness.</i>
            </b></p>
        <p><b><h1 style="color:brown;">2.Hatha Yoga:</h1>
           <i>Hatha yoga relies extensively on postures and asanas for its benefit. In fact, the combination of the syllables ha and tha itself is supposed to awaken the two governing energies of life.
             Of all the types of yoga, this is the one that focuses on the need of advancing the life forces, energy, the chakra and the kundalini the most.
            Hatha Yoga is all about promoting the spiritual and mental well- being of a person. It consists of asana that is followed by the six shatkarmas.
             Both these put together form the physical and mental detox. It also includes Pranayama, bandhas, which are spiritual awakening and energy revealing practices.
            Hatha yoga is done in combination by combining all these practices.
            The asanas are supposed to rid the body of diseases, following which one can focus on making the body and the mind fit.
            The shatkarmas aid in cleansing the body, so that none of the energy is restrained or kept back.</b></p>
        <p><b><h1 style="color:brown;">3.Mantra Yoga:</h1>
            <i>Mantra Yoga is the type of yoga that is practiced through the chanting of mantras. Thousands of mantras exist and it is believed that the vibrations released by 
                these mantras can really help a person achieve their dreams and even cure diseases. What mantra yoga focuses on is learning these mantras in the right way. 
                These mantras are believed to have a lot of power and it will not do for people to just chant them any way they want. Some guidance is required in this sphere,
                 to practice this branch of yoga in an effective manner.Practice of mantra yoga requires some items as well- such as incense sticks, rosaries, etc. 
                 There are two ways in which the mantras in this type of yoga are divided.</i></b></p>
        <p><b><h1 style="color:brown;">4.Bhakti Yoga:</h1>
            <i>This branch of yoga is based completely on faith and belief. While practicing yoga, it is generally suggested that the person place their faith and belief 
                on some supreme power such as God or any higher consciousness. One of the most important prerequisites for doing this kind of yoga is to be actually interested in it and invested in it.
                People have to believe in this kind of yoga when they are doing it or the emotional flow and the energy derived from the yoga will not be beneficial at all.
                 The biggest benefit of practicing Bhakti Yoga, out of all types of yoga is the fact that this can help cure a person's mental and emotional problems in such a way 
                 that their relationships with other people can also be improved.</i></b></p>
        <p><b><h1 style="color:brown;">5.Jnana Yoga :</h1>
            <i>This kind of yoga is something related to the knowledge and the wisdom derived from practicing yoga. It is the tradition that is used to achieve meditative strength and wisdom as well.
                In Jnana yoga, a person derives his knowledge and his awareness through meditation. Meditation will help the person introspect and find rational answers to all questions that plague the body and mind.
                Of course, Jnana Yoga can be practiced by people alone or with the help of a guru. The basic goals that this branch of yoga wishes to achieve is the experience of knowledge, developing wisdom and inner peace,
                realizing the truth and one's own nature and self- awareness. There is no need for any materials or things to practice this kind of yoga, for it is almost entirely about the mind and the soul.</i>></b></p>
        <p><b><h1 style="color:brown;">6.Kriya Yoga :</h1>
            <i>This type of yoga focuses on bodily activities or physical activities. It's main intention is also to achieve inner peace and realization, but it does not really do much to calm mental tension or issues. 
                Kriya yoga is a kind of yoga that would help people maintain some amount of physical fitness or even lose weight.
                There are around 70 kriyas that are a part of this kind of yoga, but only 20 of them are commonly known and practiced by people- for they are the ones that are the easier ones.
                Pranayama is a popular part of this yoga as well. This is not really a popular kind of yoga, even though there are mentions of it in Puranic texts. It has been revived recently and hopefully the revival is here to stay.
                People who are doing yoga for physical as well as mental and emotional fitness can combine this yoga with any other kind for the optimum benefit.</i></b></p>
