                    You donâ€™t just need aerobic exercise. Resistance training or weight lifting is also important. This type of exercise helps strengthen your muscles and bones and improve your balance and coordination. 
                    This reduces your risk for osteoporosis. It also helps prevent injuries or falls.Not sure how to get started? Hire a trainer for a one-time session. If you jot down the routine, you can refer to it later.</i></h2></b></p>
            <p><b><h1 style="color:brown;"> 2. Mind your money</h1><h2><i style="color:black;">You can get a great workout at home for just pennies. Fitness DVDs are a great way to exercise, and many local libraries have copies you can borrow. 
                Checking out different DVDs can be a great way to find new types of exercise you like. Another option is to tune in to a fitness show broadcast on TV. Exercise classes of all different types are available on the internet for people of all different levels of fitness.

            <p><b><h1 style="color:brown;"> 3. Stretch</h1><h2><i style="color:white;"></i>
                Stretching after a workout should always be part of your routine. Stretching improves flexibility and range of motion. It may also cut your risk of injury or muscle cramps. Finally, stretching improves circulation throughout the body.
